A pong game being written in C. This is also... probably my first official C project...
allegro made this a bit too easy actually.

Drowning in school work. Help pls. <br>
<br>
Its actually turning out to be really bad... The collisions are glitchy, and the ball's speed is not consistent at all. <br>

That said, I have zero knowledge of game dev... Its the effort that matters :D <br>
