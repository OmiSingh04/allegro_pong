A naive pong game written in C. <br>

Library - [allegro](https://liballeg.org/) <br>
Drowning in school work. Help pls. <br>
<br>
Its actually turning out to be really bad... The collisions are glitchy, and the ball's speed is not consistent at all. <br>

That said, I have zero knowledge of game dev... Its the effort that matters :D <br>

reeeeeeeeeeeeee<br>
Now I just need to dispose the components properly. <br>

Dispossssssed. <br>

to run... <br>

1) clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmiSingh04/allegro_pong.git
cd allegro_pong
```

2) Change file mode (only once)

```bash
sudo chmod +x run.sh
```

3) run the script (library must be installed, i just got it off apt)

```bash
./run.sh
```
